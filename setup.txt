Setup:

* Code assumes that RethinkDB and InfluxDB are running on localhost, and exposed
  via their default ports.
* All output data (including temporary-ish files) are stored in the "output"
  subdirectory of the current working directory when run.
* Refernces to debugging/zlib can be replaced as references to "compress/zlib"
  from the Go standard library, similarly with debugging/flate and
  "compress/flate". A bug can be fixed by commenting out the "if max == 0 {"
  block in "(h *huffmanDecoder) init(bits []int) bool".

mkdir -p output/gitpack
mkdir -p output/globpack
mkdir -p output/refpack

Make the following RethinkDB tables in the "gitglob" database
queued_packs
queued_updates
objects
refs_latest
refs_history


To run:
go build .
./gitglob -queue=update
./gitglob -queue=pack

Run the two separate gitglob instances in parallel. You can add additional
instances if you want, this should allow additional processing in some cases.
There are still a few noisily crashing bugs yet, so you may have to restart
the processes in some cases.
